I am a Master student in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada working in the [Cryptography Security and Privacy (CrySP)](https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/) lab. [Ian Goldberg](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~iang/) is my supervisor.

 My research focuses on privacy enhancing technologies and censorship circumvention systems.
