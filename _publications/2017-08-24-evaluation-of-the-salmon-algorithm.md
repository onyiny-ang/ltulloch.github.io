excerpt: 'The salmon algorithm is a metaheuristic inspired by the behaviour of salmon swimming upstream to spawn. In this paper the salmon algorithm is evaluated for the construction of optimal covering and error-correcting codes, which are related to sequencing applications, as well as for the DNA fragment assembly problem.'
