I am a privacy and security research and software engineer currently working with the [LEAP Encryption Access Project](https://leap.se/) on designing robust, UDP based pluggable transports for censorship circumvention. I am a graduate of the [Cryptography Security and Privacy (CrySP)](https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/) lab (MMath 2022) at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada where I worked under [Ian Goldberg](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~iang/).

 My research focuses on privacy enhancing technologies and censorship circumvention systems.
